            <p> I drifted from job to job gaining valuable & diverse experience, I still managed to squeeze in a few web-design related projects into the mix. Whether it was a new website for the company I worked for, or building them an intranet, or updating their existing one, even volunteering to manage my church’s website, I managed to keep the web design dream somewhat alive. </p>

            <p> My design work is particulary artistic, which is also highlighted on her website. Studying the site design is a good way to broaden your vision, especially in regard to the color scheme and textbook-like minimalism.The design is made using HTML,CSS,Bootstrap. Though the visual design is not particularly outstanding, the content more than makes up for it.</p>
